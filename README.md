# Strategy Pattern

Design Pattern Strategy example

# Why?

Here we have 3 type of vehicle.

the car drive, the boat sail and the plane fly.

But, it can change, and of course, sometimes we have to use 
multiple actions for a single vehicle.

The package algorithm use an interface called "Move"

Every action "Drive","Sail","Fly" extend this interface (polymorphisme...)

This design pattern is usefull when you need to change the action of an object.

I hope this example will help you to understand the Strategy Pattern.

Enjoy !
